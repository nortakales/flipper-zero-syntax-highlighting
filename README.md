# Flipper Zero: Syntax Highlighting

This is a VSCode extension which adds synatx highlighting for Flipper Zero files like `.sub`, `.nfc`, `.rfid`, `.ir`, etc.

# Known Issues

Still missing support for iButton and BadUSB. I will add these soon. Also, probably missing support for older version of Flipper files since the some of the formats have changed a bit over time.
